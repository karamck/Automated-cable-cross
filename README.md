This is my Automated Cable Cross machine for my final project in ECE 387. I wanted to prototype a machine for beginners to make it more useful and intuitive. Cable excercises are some of the best for beginners because they are not intimidating like deadlifts and bench presses, but they are often told to do a lift without instruction. My machine's touch screen interface is vary easy to read, all of the excercicses featured can be pressed and the arms of the machine will move the postion for the lift. The arrows next to the picture control the corresponding arms. Arms can be moved up and down for personal prefrences for an excercise or for a custom lift. The servos have full range of motion, unlike the preset locations of the typical cable machine. The arms can also be rotated forward and back for an even wider range of excercises.
